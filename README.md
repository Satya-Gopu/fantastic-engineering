### Artsy
- [Future Fridays](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/12/22/future-fridays/)

### Atlassian
- [ShipIt](https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit)
24 hours to innovate. It's like 20% time. On steroids. Find what inspires you. Develop that dream feature.

### Peer Lab
- [Peer Lab](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/)
Developers gather in a physical space to work on things. If someone has a question, they ask the group. If you can help, you offer assistance. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone feels fulfilled.

### Thoughtbot
- [Investment Time](https://thoughtbot.com/jobs)
